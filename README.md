#  LRNR APP (group 1)

 Our team has designed an application called LRNR, that utilizes the Anthropic Claude API to create a customized quiz based on user input. The application was written by Red Ventures AI engineers using jQuery, and GO; however, our team has rewritten this application in Node.js, React, and Vite. The LRNR app consists of several pages, but it is relatively easy to navigate.

2. A static **Account page** is included, where users are able to “view” their user data, but there is currently no logic implemented to make the features on this page functional.

3. The **Quiz Generation page** is where users are allowed to select specific categories provided by lrnr, in order to generate a personalized quiz based on the criteria they provide. Users have the option to generate a quiz based on programming languages including Golang, AWS, and  JavaScript; programming essentials like  CI/CD; and miscellaneous information such as Home Gardens, Coffee, and finger foods.
Users can also select an expertise level, ranging from novice, intermediate, and expert. This allows for further customization and progression throughout the learning process. The last selection provided on the quiz generator page includes the number of questions, ranging from 5,10, and 15 questions.

4. Upon The completion of the quiz-generated criteria, the application redirects to the generated **Quiz page**. This is where users take the quiz provided with the hopes  of gaining proficiency in the specific concept selected. Answers are scored based on accuracy (out of 100%). Whenever a user's input is incorrect, the application provides an error message, as well as a detailed explanation of the correct answer and the definition or logic behind it.

5. Lastly, there is the **Results page**. The quiz results page is intended to provide a summary of correctly answered questions, quantify quiz results, and provide the option to try another quiz. Because this page has no logic implemented to make it functional, the page was programmed statically using React components.
